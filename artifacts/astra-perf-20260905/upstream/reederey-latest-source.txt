# GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3 on 2× NVIDIA DGX Spark

Reproduction kit for a **production** deployment of GLM-5.3-Flash (320B MoE / 18B
active) on two NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10 Grace Blackwell, 121 GiB unified memory each):
a **1,000,000-token context window** with DFlash2 speculative decoding, TP=2 over a
direct 200Gb QSFP link, loopback-only by default.

This is the deployment I actually run, with every gotcha written down. Since
2026-08-30 the serving image is **built by this repo's `Dockerfile`** — production
runs the local build, not a pulled artifact.

## Why this kit, in numbers

The most frustrating thing about every GLM-5.3-Flash config I ran before this one
was not decode speed — it was **prefix-cache misses and prefill latency**. A config
that passed every acceptance check would read **0% cache hits** under real agentic
traffic (each turn re-read the whole history), and with a few coding agents attached
time-to-first-token ran **80–160 s** while effective prefill collapsed from ~900 to
**~160 tok/s**. Nothing was logged; the counters just read zero.

The cause is the model, not a mis-set flag: GLM-5.3-Flash is a hybrid KDA(mamba)+MLA
architecture, cached in **3,584-token pages** whose KDA state is checkpointed only
when a scheduler step ends exactly on a page boundary — and one missing checkpoint
vetoes every attention hit. On top of that, the DFlash2 drafter's eagle-style prune
silently dropped the last page of every hit. Fixing this is most of what separates
this tree from the recipe it started from:

| Measured before | Fix in this tree | Measured after |
|---|---|---|
| Hits read 0% at upstream `MNBT=1024` (chunk ends miss the page boundary) | `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS` = the 3,584 page size, async scheduling OFF | solo 110k replay **97–98%** |
| Every hit lost its last page (N−1 of N) | `overlay/patch_hybrid_prefix_hit.py` — prune scoped to the drafter's own group | full-N-page hits |
| Multi-session retention collapse — 2×68k sessions **0%** (163 s) | per-group retention (`overlay/patch_apc_per_group_retention.py`): drafter SWA boundaries-only, MLA/mamba dense | **100%** (1.3 s) |
| Co-batch zero-insertion — 4×60k concurrent **0%** (288 s) | per-group sparse retention (the global knob was the old thrash) | **98.7%** (16.5 s) |
| Prompts under ~3.6k could never hit, and every follow-up re-read up to a page | `overlay/patch_fine_grained_apc.py` — hits reconcile at the 64-token hash grain instead of the 3,584-token page | a 2.6k prompt reuses **2,816** tokens; follow-ups reuse **96–99%** (~4.1 s → ~1.0 s per turn) |
| Toggling thinking on/off threw the whole prefix away (50k prompt: 56.8 s re-read) | chat template emits the `Reasoning Effort` line unconditionally — the off-shape is a strict extension of the on-shape | toggle hits **100%** (0.26 s) |
| Short request stuck behind a 240k read — **256 s** TTFT | `LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD=1792` fairness cap | **6.7–7.9 s** (gate v3; earlier builds measured 5.3–7.9) |
| First turn after every restart cold | `local/content-warmup.sh` pre-reads the shared system prompt at boot | warm on turn 1 |
| Two CPU cores spinning flat-out during every decode (SoC heat, no work) | `overlay/patch_spinwait_gb10.py` — vLLM's 1 s reader spin cut to 2 ms | spinning core freed, head hot zones **−5 °C**, throughput unchanged (same-day control) |

Mechanism, the remaining cautions, and how to verify on your own pair (a lifetime
hit-rate on a dashboard hides all of this): `docs/04-prefix-caching.md`,
`docs/08-concurrent-prefill.md`; probes `local/cache-burst.py`, `local/cache-probe.sh`,
`local/ttft-probe.py`.

The headline figures, same pair:

| | |
|---|---|
| Context window | **1,000,000 tokens**, with speculation active — on two desk machines |
| **Prose decode** | **~28–31 tok/s** at the 1M window — the most reliable real-workload figure we track (natural prose acceptance is ~0.3–0.4, so this is what unstructured generation actually costs; it is also the number least inflated by a high-acceptance prompt) |
| Structured decode | **~67 tok/s** at speculative acceptance **1.0000** (7/7 drafted tokens accepted, every converged pass) — treat this as the **acceptance/quality gate, not the headline throughput**: near-ceiling structured prompts are the most favorable regime, not the realistic workload. Concurrency medians land wherever ambient traffic puts them; the durable invariant is the acceptance profile |
| Cold prefill | **~1000–1070 tok/s** solo at 240k (pipelined fat-GEMM MoE; same-day controls; see note below) |
| 500k prompt, drafter on | **854 tok/s** cold (2026-08-30 battery, pre-kernel-stack image); same prompt replayed from cache **111× faster** (5.3 s) |
| Short request behind a 240k read | **6.7–7.9 s** to first token (mixed-prefill gate v3 with the 512→1792 aging ladder; 256 s without this kit's fairness cap) |
| Multi-agent concurrency | **4 in-flight generations**; a warm follow-up lands in **~2.6 s behind a running generation** (45.8 s before the mixed-prefill gate); decode keeps **+27% tokens per fixed window** during a co-batched cold read; cached-conversation capacity ≈ **50,176 tokens ≈ 14 sessions** under per-group retention — replays at 86% of the pool cost retention (4×200k: 49.9%), plan concurrency below that |
| Multi-session caching | 2×68k sessions retain **100%**; 4×60k concurrent retain **98.7%** |
| Follow-up turns | reuse **96–99%** of the prompt at 64-token grain — even prompts under one 3,584-token page |

Prefill and content type, honestly: the prefill figures come from natural-language
(word-salad) probes. Prefill is compute-bound on this stack, so **tokens/second is
essentially content-independent** — but **tokens per document is not**: code and
JSON tokenize denser (more tokens per kB), so the same document can cost 20–50%
more prompt tokens and proportionally longer TTFT. Read the rows above as
per-token rates, not per-document promises. The 240k receipts (906–1072 tok/s,
full-set median 1001) were measured under same-day controls with the pipelined
fat-GEMM MoE (`docs/06`, 2026-09-02 S2b entry).

No other public recipe serves this model on this hardware with all five of: EXL3
(the only quantization GB10 can actually run — it lacks the instruction NVFP4
compiles to), a 1M window that *coexists* with speculative decoding, prefix caching
that survives the hybrid-KDA architecture and the drafter, perfect structured
acceptance, and a hand-tuned MoE kernel stack (packed-expert fat GEMM, dynamic
ticket scheduling, and a 3-stage `cp.async` pipeline measured **+41%** over the
base recipe's kernels at production shapes). Each of those is a specific fix in
this tree, and removing any one of them has a measured cost
(`docs/10-selfbuild-production.md`, "load-bearing set"; kernel receipts
`docs/06`, 2026-09-02 entries).

Metric provenance, honestly: the cache/latency rows were re-measured on
2026-08-31 on the self-built image with all of this repo's fixes active (decode =
medians of 3+ converged temp-0 passes; prefill and latency rows are matched
same-day probe runs — a reference from another day or image drifts by a few
percent, so every A/B here runs its control arm the same day). The kernel rows
are from the 2026-09-02 wave (fat-GEMM pipeline adopted; isolated kernel
**+41%** at production shapes, bit-exact ×56). End-to-end prefill vs the
same-day control is **parity under ambient bursts** (240k full-set median
**+0.3%**, individual passes −3.2% to +7.4%) — do not read the isolated kernel
gain as a matching tok/s jump. The 500k/111× replay row is from the
2026-08-30 cutover battery on the same image. Every bench and probe ships in
`tests/` and `local/` — reproduce any row in minutes. The offline regression
suite runs with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pytest tests/ -q`.

## The serving image: preview vLLM, pinned and completed

The base is `vllm/vllm-openai:glm53-flash-arm64-cu130` — the **day-0 GLM-5.3 preview
image**, carrying a *pre-release* vLLM dev build (`0.1.dev20051+g487ecf187`) cut from
the official enablement lineage **before** it merged upstream (#53906 is still open,
and the tree predates vLLM's native DFlash2). Preview code is why this kit pins the
base **by digest** and adds every capability explicitly, verified on the real pair:

- **EXL3 kernels** — `exllamav3` built for aarch64/sm_121 at a pinned commit; keeps
  the 320B experts packed at 82 GiB/node, which is what leaves room for the 1M pool.
- **MoE expert kernels, hand-tuned for GB10** — this repo's fat-expert GEMM for
  oversized prefill experts, upstream's dynamic ticket scheduler in the fused
  launch, and a 3-stage `cp.async` pipeline (+41% kernel throughput at production
  shapes; `docs/11`).
- **The DFlash2 drafter end to end** — model, speculator, aux-hidden-state capture;
  none of it exists in the preview tree (we booted the raw base nine times to prove
  exactly what's missing — `docs/09-rebase-draft-test.md`).
- **KV slot-share** — without it the drafter caps the servable window near 358k;
  with it, 1M + speculation coexist.
- **Correctness backports** the preview tree predates: xgrammar termination
  (#52805/#53046 — acceptance 0.98→1.0000), the #54282 draft-noise salt, a
  long-generation kernel clamp.
- **Hybrid-KDA prefix caching under speculation** — page-aligned geometry, sparse
  retention, drafter-group fixes; upstream is converging on the same (#54163).

When official support merges, `docs/07`/`docs/09` are the map forward — with the
known landmine flagged (upstream's Aug-22 refactor broke DFlash2 loading on main).

## What's in the box

| | |
|---|---|
| Weights | [`brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw`](https://huggingface.co/brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw) — uniform-K4 EXL3/TR3, ~164 GiB, pinned revision |
| Runtime | **Built by `Dockerfile` here** from the digest-pinned preview base ([NOTICE](NOTICE)) |
| Drafter | `incoai/GLM-5.3-Flash-DFlash2`, k=7, BF16, **pinned to commit `7d74cdd`** — the Hub repo has shipped three different weights under the same name; the two newer ones were A/B-tested here and won nothing (one loses 6% on prose) |
| Ops | memory-gated restarts, crash/wedge/stop-aware watchdog, acceptance alerting, Xid monitoring, systemd units |

Key local hardening, all marked `# LOCAL:` in-file: **loopback bind hardcoded**
(upstream ships `0.0.0.0` on `--network host` — an open model on your LAN; verify
with `ss -ltn | grep 8000` after any update), **KV pool pinned to the byte** (never
raise it — `docs/02`), and **`MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS` = the 3,584-token page size
with async scheduling OFF** — get either wrong and cache hits silently read 0%
(`docs/04`).

## Quickstart

```bash
# on the head node
git clone <this repo> glm53 && cd glm53
cp env.example .env         # read it top to bottom — every value is a decision
docker build -t glm53-selfbuild .   # from the digest-pinned base; ship to the worker too
bash download.sh            # ~164 GiB of weights, verified against the pinned revision
local/prod-start.sh         # NOT start.sh directly — see docs/03-bringup.md
local/acceptance.sh         # 7 checks: tools, thinking, vision, long-context needle
```

Then install the units in `local/` (`systemctl --user enable ...`) so the pair
survives reboots and heals itself. Full drill: `docs/03-bringup.md`.

This release is reproduce-tested: this exact tree was rebuilt on the production head
and booted **as production**, passing acceptance 7/7, serving 6/6, a byte-identical
KV pool (1,396,551 tokens), and 1.0000/7.0 structured acceptance on first boot.

## API surface notes (this build)

**Cache reset** — `POST /reset_prefix_cache` (from `overlay/patch_cache_reset.py`)
empties a cold cache without a restart; returns `{"success": false}` while blocks
are held, retry after requests drain. Auth caveat: the bearer middleware guards only
`/v1`-style prefixes, so root-mounted routes (`/tokenize`, `/detokenize`, the cache
reset) answer without the key — set `GLM53_EXPOSE_CACHE_RESET=0` for untrusted
clients. **Tokenize** is mounted at the root (`/v1/tokenize` is 404) and validates
`prompt`/`messages`, not `text`.

## The CUDA kernels changed recently (read before upgrading)

> The MoE expert path in this tree is no longer upstream's stock `exllamav3`
> code: this repo carries (1) the **fat-expert GEMM** (`overlay/exl3_fat_gemm.cu`
> — oversized prefill experts run a fused trellis-GEMM + Hadamard + scatter
> launch instead of per-expert reconstruction), (2) the **dynamic ticket
> scheduler** in the fused `exl3_moe` kernel (upstream exllamav3 `d5e4361`,
> cherry-picked — idle SM groups steal heavy experts instead of round-robin),
> and (3) a **3-stage `cp.async` pipeline** in the fat GEMM k-loop —
> **+38.6/+41.4/+40.8%** kernel throughput at production shapes (52 → ~73.5
> TFLOP/s), bit-exact vs the stock kernel over 56 comparisons,
> compute-sanitizer-clean. End-to-end prefill vs the same-day control is
> parity under ambient bursts (240k full-set median +0.3%, individual passes
> −3.2% to +7.4%; 2026-09-02;
> `docs/11-gb10-kernel-program.md` is the full program ledger, with the rejected
> arms too). If you update `exllamav3` or rebuild, the JIT-cache shape guard
> wipes Triton/TileLang caches on **both** nodes by design; and if you touch the
> `.cu`, the validation gates in `docs/11` §6 (bit-exactness sweep,
> compute-sanitizer, kernel and end-to-end benches) are the bar — the first
> pipeline draft failed bit-exactness on every shape from a one-line `cp.async`
> source-offset bug. `docs/12` documents why a drop-in replacement
> (Sparkinfer's Trellis) stays parked behind a measured trigger.

## The experiments that lost (read before "optimizing")

The improvement program (`docs/06`, `docs/08`, `docs/10`, `docs/11`) records
every tested change, including the rejections — with numbers, so you don't re-pay
for them: a community-recommended prefill config (+3.7% cold prefill, but −3.3–4%
on every decoded token and −12% pool); FlashInfer's radix top-k (zero gain at
draft-batch sizes); a bigger draft length (k=8: prose −9%); dual-rail NCCL (loses
at production geometry); both newer DFlash2 drafter checkpoints (no win, one −6%
prose — the pin stays on `7d74cdd`); sharding the drafter across ranks
(`DFLASH_DRAFT_TP=2` — tested twice, single-stream *and* at 4-way concurrency: a
wash here, and the head node's memory gets slightly worse); the row-tiling arms
of the fat-expert path (`EXL3_MOE_ROW_TILE=1` and a `EXL3_TEMP_ROWS_FUSED`
ladder — both directions lose prefill to the stock 128-row config, and the
row-tile path costs −20.9% once it bypasses the tuned fat kernel). We also chased
the reported long-context decode collapse (acceptance falling to 16% past 100k)
and could not reproduce it on this stack — structured acceptance stays 0.93–0.98
per position out to ~195k tokens. If a knob isn't set the way upstream defaults
it, there's a measured reason in those docs.
